If you're looking for the archive of NLRB elections, you've come to the right place! 

While these files are publicly available through the NLRB, it is confusing to track them down, and some years require a FOIA request.
So I set up a repository here where the files are available. Here you will find both the raw files from the NLRB, and a do-file that cleans and merges separate years into one.

**Raw Files:** The NLRB has one CSV for all elections 1977-1999, one XLS file for all elections 2000-2010, and then individual XLS files annually.

**Do File:** This is a work-in-progress, as the different years of data use different variables and harmoizing them may be project-dependent.

The current do-file focuses on the following variables across years: state, date, eligible voters, votes for union, votes against union, and outcome (win / loss).

If you find any bugs in this code, please let me know and I will update the GitHub for future users! I am available at **watson@bu.edu**
